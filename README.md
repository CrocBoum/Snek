# Snek

My go at Snek, inspired by @planetchili's C++ Tutorial Series.

His Framework and Sounds were used.

My code can be found in Game.h, Game.cpp, Snake.h, Snake.cpp, Board.h, Board.cpp, and a few small additions in other files

I know, the commits are very scattered and badly organized. Oh well.
